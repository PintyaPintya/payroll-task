# Payroll Management System

Objective:
Develop a payroll management system using .NET Core. The system should handle user authentication, authorization, employee data management, payroll task assignment, task submission, code review scheduling, and caching using Redis.

Features and Functionalities
User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and token-based authentication.
Define roles such as Admin, Manager, and Employee to manage access permissions:
Admin: Can manage users, assign payroll tasks, review submissions, and approve or reject tasks.
Manager: Can view reports, monitor task statuses, and participate in code reviews.
Employee: Can view assigned tasks, submit completed tasks, and respond to feedback.
Employee Management:

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage employee details, including personal information, role, and payroll eligibility.
Ensure proper data validation (e.g., unique email, valid salary range).
Payroll Task Assignment:

Admin Functionality:
Admin can assign payroll-related tasks to employees. Each task contains a description, due date, and any necessary resources or files.
Implement an API endpoint for assigning tasks, which notifies the employee through an email or system notification.
Track the status of each task (Assigned, Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected).
Task Submission:

Employee Functionality:
Employees can submit completed payroll tasks in a zip format.
Implement an API endpoint for employees to upload their task submissions securely.
On submission, the task status should change to Submitted, and a notification should be sent to the Admin for review.
Code Review Process:

Admin Functionality:
Admin can review submitted tasks and either approve them directly or request a code review meeting.
Implement an API endpoint to schedule a code review meeting if needed.
Calendar Integration:
Integrate with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar or Outlook) to schedule review calls. Send meeting invites to the employee, admin, and any other relevant stakeholders.
The system should automatically update the task status to Under Review when a review meeting is scheduled.
Review Approval:
After the review call, Admin can approve or reject the task:
If approved, the employee is marked as eligible for payroll for the current cycle.
If rejected, feedback is provided, and the employee may need to resubmit.
Caching with Redis:

Utilize Redis to cache frequently accessed data such as employee details, assigned tasks, and task statuses to improve performance.
Implement cache invalidation strategies to update or remove outdated data when changes are made (e.g., after task approval or employee updates).
Reporting and Analytics:

Generate reports on task assignments, completion rates, and approval statuses.
Provide filters to view data by date range, employee, or task status.
Audit Logging:

Implement audit logging to track task assignments, submissions, status changes, and approvals or rejections.
Logs should capture details such as user ID, timestamp, operation performed, and any changes made.
Database Management:

Use Entity Framework Core for managing database operations.
Design a normalized database schema to handle employees, tasks, submissions, roles, and review schedules.
Technical Requirements
Technology Stack:

.NET Core 6.0+ for Web API.
Entity Framework Core for ORM.
SQL Server or PostgreSQL for the database.
Redis for caching.
JWT for authentication and role-based authorization.
Project Structure:

Follow a clean architecture pattern (e.g., separation of concerns using layers like API, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure).
Dependency Injection:

Use .NET Core's built-in dependency injection for managing service lifetimes.
Configuration:

Store sensitive information like connection strings, JWT keys, and Redis configuration securely using appsettings.json and environment variables.
Error Handling and Validation:

Implement global error handling and model validation to ensure robust and user-friendly API responses.
Documentation:

Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
Include code comments and a README file with setup instructions.
